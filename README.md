## ðŸ“œ About

This repository is intended to provide open source scripts that extend or automate functionality in **StashDB**.  
Currently, it contains a single script, but more will be added over time as development continues.

The goal is to make it easier for the community to share helpful tools, small automations, and enhancements that improve the StashDB experience.
